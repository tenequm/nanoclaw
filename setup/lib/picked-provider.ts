/**
 * The agent runtime the operator picked in THIS setup run, carried to the
 * group-creation child processes over the process boundary.
 *
 * There is no `--provider` flag in the creation contract — provider is a DB
 * property of a group. Setup persists the pick two ways: as the install-wide
 * default (`DEFAULT_AGENT_PROVIDER` in `.env`, see src/config.ts), which every
 * future group inherits at creation via the `ensureContainerConfig` chokepoint;
 * and here, in a setup-run-scoped env var, so the FIRST agent created in the
 * same run (by `init-first-agent` / `init-cli-agent`, which run as child
 * processes) is stamped with the pick before the welcome wakes the container —
 * without waiting for the host to restart and reload `.env`. `undefined`
 * means no run-scoped pick; the creation scripts then fall back to the
 * install-wide default. An explicit `'claude'` pick is carried like any other,
 * so a run that chose Claude over a stamped non-Claude default is served as a
 * Claude run (failure assist included), and the group it creates is stamped
 * with the same value the successful sign-in writes to `.env`.
