/**
 * Wiring-creation helpers over channel default declarations.

 * Every path that creates a messaging_group_agents row (ncl, setup wizard,
 * card-approval flow, bootstrap scripts) resolves its engage defaults through
 * resolveWiringDefaults; every path that auto-creates a messaging_groups row
 * resolves its policy through resolveUnknownSenderPolicy. The router's fanout
 * consults resolveThreadPolicy at runtime — threading is the one per-wiring
 * setting that stays live (NULL = inherit the declaration) rather than being
 * snapshotted at creation.
 *
 * Context selection everywhere: isGroup = event.message.isGroup ??
 * (mg.is_group === 1) — NEVER `threadId !== null` (DM sub-threads exist on
 * Slack/Discord, and non-threaded group platforms have null threadIds).
