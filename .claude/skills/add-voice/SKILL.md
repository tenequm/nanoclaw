# Add Live Voice

Adds full-duplex browser conversations using [GPT-Live-1](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/live) as a
voice channel. The voice model handles listening and speaking in real time;
every turn that needs facts, memory, tools or an action is delegated to a
NanoClaw session, whose reply is spoken back. Native adapter: the host creates
the live session, attaches a server-side sideband WebSocket, and maps
delegations to inbound messages and agent replies to spoken commentary.
NanoClaw doesn't ship channels in trunk — this skill copies the adapter and its
tests in from the `channels` branch.

A **voice line** is one call link, `…/webhook/voice/call?t=<token>`, wired to
one agent group. Every call on the link lands in the same agent session, so the
agent remembers the previous call. Inside NanoClaw the line goes by a _line id_,
a hash of the token, so the token itself stays in the link and never reaches the
database, the logs or the agent. This skill sets up one line for a browser.
Browser is the only supported client today. Future push-to-talk can be a mode of
the same live conversation; recorded asynchronous voice messages are a separate
capability. Native apps and SIP are future clients, not installed by this skill.

Costs money: OpenAI bills voice sessions at $0.05 per minute, per second, plus
the agent's own model usage. The link token is the only thing between the
internet and that bill — treat the link like a password.

Calls end after 15 minutes, and each line permits at most 12 start attempts in
an hour. Set `GPT_LIVE_MAX_CALL_SECONDS` (default `900`) and
`GPT_LIVE_MAX_CALLS_PER_HOUR` (default `12`) to positive integers to change these
limits. Attempts include upstream failures. The hourly counters are in memory
and reset when the host restarts; these are call limits, not a dollar budget.

The stable channel identifier and URL prefix are `voice`. The `GPT_LIVE_*`
settings and adapter module names identify the current voice engine.

## Apply

### 1. Copy the adapter and tests

Fetch the `channels` branch and copy the adapter, its session state machine,
the voice prompt composer, the call page, and their tests into place
(overwrite — the branch is canonical):

```nc:copy from-branch:channels
src/channels/voice.ts
src/channels/gpt-live-session.ts
src/channels/gpt-live-prompt.ts
src/channels/gpt-live-call-page.ts
src/channels/gpt-live-keychain.ts
src/channels/gpt-live-sideband.ts
src/channels/voice-adapter.test.ts
src/channels/voice-registration.test.ts
src/channels/gpt-live-session.test.ts
src/channels/gpt-live-access.test.ts
src/channels/gpt-live-keychain.test.ts
src/channels/gpt-live-sideband.test.ts
src/channels/gpt-live-call-page.test.ts
```

### 2. Register the adapter

Append the self-registration import to the channel barrel (skipped if present).
This one line is the skill's only reach-in into the channel core:

```nc:append to:src/channels/index.ts
import './voice.js';
```

### 3. Teach agents to write for the ear

Replies on this channel are spoken. Mount the formatting skill so every agent
answers a call in short plain prose. `container/skills/` is mounted read-only
into every agent container; the skill only changes behaviour when a message
arrives from the `voice` channel. Copy it separately so reapplying missing adapter
files does not overwrite a customized formatting skill:

```nc:copy from-branch:channels
container/skills/voice-formatting/SKILL.md
```

### 4. Build

No new package: the adapter uses Node's built-in `fetch` and WebSocket client
(Node 22 or later, which NanoClaw already requires). Build first: it guards the
adapter's typed calls into the channel core.

```nc:run effect:build
pnpm run build
```

### 5. Validate

Run the registration test, the session state-machine tests, and the adapter
integration test (a fake OpenAI behind the real webhook server):

```nc:run effect:test
pnpm exec vitest run src/channels/voice-registration.test.ts src/channels/voice-adapter.test.ts src/channels/gpt-live-session.test.ts src/channels/gpt-live-access.test.ts src/channels/gpt-live-keychain.test.ts src/channels/gpt-live-sideband.test.ts src/channels/gpt-live-call-page.test.ts
```

`voice-registration.test.ts` imports the real channel barrel and asserts the
registry contains `voice` — it goes red if the import line drifts.
`gpt-live-session.test.ts` covers the delegation bookkeeping (transcript cut,
chunking, barge-in). `voice-adapter.test.ts` drives the call page and SDP
routes over HTTP, checks the session is created in client-delegation mode with
the wired agent's name, and round-trips a delegation to an inbound message and
a reply to spoken commentary over the sideband. A real call is verified
manually once the service runs.

## Connect to OpenAI

### API key

The adapter needs an OpenAI API key with access to `gpt-live-1`. It is read on
the host only; the agent container never sees it. Two places it can live:
pasted into `.env`, or (macOS) in your login Keychain, where `.env` only names
the item and the host reads it at startup with the system `security` tool.

```nc:prompt key_source validate:^(paste|keychain)$ normalize:lower
Where should the OpenAI key live? "paste" writes it to .env; "keychain" (macOS) keeps it in your login Keychain and .env only names the item. (paste/keychain)
```

**Paste** — collected as a secret and written to `.env`:

```nc:prompt openai_api_key secret validate:^sk-.{20,}$ normalize:trim when:key_source=paste
Paste an OpenAI API key with access to gpt-live-1 (starts with sk-). Create one at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

```nc:env-set when:key_source=paste
OPENAI_API_KEY={{openai_api_key}}
```

**Keychain** — the user adds the item in their own terminal, so the key never
passes through this setup or their shell history. The shell reads the key
with `read -s` rather than `security`'s own hidden prompt, which silently cuts
input at 128 characters (project keys are longer); `-T` lets the `security`
tool read the item back without a dialog. Tell the user:

```nc:operator when:key_source=keychain
Run this in a terminal; when it says "Paste the OpenAI key", paste it (nothing is echoed) and press Enter: printf 'Paste the OpenAI key, then press Enter: '; read -s KEY; echo; security add-generic-password -U -s nanoclaw-openai -a "$USER" -T /usr/bin/security -w "$KEY"; unset KEY
```

```nc:env-set when:key_source=keychain
GPT_LIVE_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE=nanoclaw-openai
```

Check the item reads back before going on (the value goes nowhere):

```nc:run effect:check when:key_source=keychain
security find-generic-password -s nanoclaw-openai -a "$USER" -w >/dev/null
```

### Public URL

The call page and the SDP handshake are served by the host's webhook server.
Give the origin a caller's browser reaches it at — `http://localhost:3000` for
a local try, a tailnet or tunnel URL to call from a phone's browser. Browsers
allow the microphone only on `localhost` or HTTPS. Set-if-absent, so a re-run
keeps your value:

On a tailnet, `tailscale serve` gives the host an HTTPS name with a valid
certificate. Mount the webhook path on it; the target repeats the path because
serve strips the mount prefix before proxying (run as root or a Tailscale
operator; an existing mount at `/` for another service is unaffected):

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --set-path=/webhook http://127.0.0.1:3000/webhook
```

The origin is then `https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net` and the call page lives at
`…/webhook/voice/call?t=<token>`.

```nc:prompt public_url validate:^https?://\S+$ normalize:rstrip-slash
What origin can a caller's browser reach this NanoClaw host at? (e.g. http://localhost:3000 or https://nanoclaw.example.ts.net)
```

```nc:env-set
GPT_LIVE_PUBLIC_URL={{public_url}}
GPT_LIVE_VOICE=marin
```

### Link token

The voice line's secret. Reuse the one already in `.env` on a re-run, otherwise
mint a fresh one:

```nc:run capture:link_token validate:^[0-9a-f]{16}$ effect:fetch
grep -s '^GPT_LIVE_LINK_TOKEN=' .env | cut -d= -f2- | cut -d, -f1 | grep -E '^[0-9a-f]{16}$' || openssl rand -hex 8
```

```nc:env-set
GPT_LIVE_LINK_TOKEN={{link_token}}
```

The line id is what NanoClaw calls this link (`voice:<line id>`): the first
twelve hex characters of the token's SHA-256, derived the same way the adapter
derives it, so the token itself is never written anywhere but `.env`:

```nc:run capture:line_id validate:^[0-9a-f]{12}$ effect:fetch
printf '%s' '{{link_token}}' | node -e "let d='';process.stdin.on('data',(c)=>{d+=c}).on('end',()=>console.log(require('crypto').createHash('sha256').update(d).digest('hex').slice(0,12)))"
```

## Choose the agent

The line is wired to one agent group. List them (the NanoClaw service must be
running — `ncl` talks to it over its socket):

```nc:run capture:agent_groups effect:fetch
ncl groups list --json | jq -r 'if (.data|length)==0 then "no agent groups yet — run /init-first-agent first" else [.data[] | "\(.folder) (\(.name))"] | join(", ") end'
```

```nc:operator
Agent groups on this install: {{agent_groups}}. The voice line is wired to one of them; the voice model introduces itself with that agent's name and hands it every question that needs memory or tools.
```

```nc:prompt agent_folder validate:^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$ normalize:trim
Which agent group answers the voice line? Enter its folder name (the first column above).
```

The folder must be a real agent group — a typo must not wire the line to
nothing:

```nc:run effect:check
ncl groups list --json | jq -e --arg f '{{agent_folder}}' '.data[] | select(.folder==$f)' >/dev/null || { echo "unknown agent group folder '{{agent_folder}}' — see: ncl groups list" >&2; exit 1; }
```

## Name the caller

Each link represents one named voice-channel user. Choose the person receiving
this credential. A matching name on another channel does not link accounts or
grant owner/admin privileges. Use a separate link per person and a separate
agent workspace for a shared demo.

```nc:prompt caller_name validate:^[\p{L}\p{M}\p{N}\x20.'’_-]{1,80}$ flags:u normalize:trim
Who receives this personal call link? Enter their name (letters, numbers, spaces, apostrophes, dots, hyphens or underscores).
```

## Restart and wire

Restart the service so the adapter registers its routes and the channel type
is known to `ncl`:

```nc:run effect:restart
bash setup/lib/restart.sh
```

Create the named voice user, grant membership only to the chosen agent, and
create a strict line with a known-sender wiring. Each command is independent;
the validated name allows Unicode and apostrophes while excluding shell syntax:

```nc:run effect:wire
ncl users create --id "voice:{{line_id}}" --kind voice --display-name "{{caller_name}}"
ncl users update --id "voice:{{line_id}}" --display-name "{{caller_name}}"
ncl members add --user "voice:{{line_id}}" --group "$(ncl groups list --json | jq -er --arg f '{{agent_folder}}' '.data[] | select(.folder==$f) | .id')"
ncl messaging-groups list --json | jq -e --arg p "voice:{{line_id}}" '.data[] | select(.platform_id==$p)' >/dev/null || ncl messaging-groups create --channel-type voice --platform-id "voice:{{line_id}}" --name "Personal voice line" --is-group 0 --unknown-sender-policy strict
ncl wirings create --channel-type voice --platform-id "voice:{{line_id}}" --agent-group "{{agent_folder}}" --session-mode shared --sender-scope known
```

The adapter checks the named caller's membership before returning private agent
information or starting a billable session. Both models receive the configured
caller name and voice user ID. Spoken names and browser fields cannot override
that binding. Access is rechecked before every delegation/reply and every five
seconds during a call; revocation or a changed wiring ends the call.

Tell the user where to call from:

```nc:operator
The call link is {{public_url}}/webhook/voice/call?t={{link_token}} — keep it private, anyone holding it is treated as {{caller_name}} and can talk to {{agent_folder}} on your OpenAI bill. Open it in a browser, allow the microphone, press Call and say hello. Ask something that needs memory ("what did we decide about the launch date?") to see the agent get involved; the page shows captions when the call carries them.
```

## Smoke test without a microphone

Before the first real call, prove the key, the account, and the delegation
round trip from the host alone. The probe opens a Live session with the same
voice prompt the adapter uses, attaches the production sideband, plays a short
caller question synthesized with macOS `say`, answers the delegation the way
the adapter would, and reports whether the voice model spoke the answer back.
It costs a few cents of voice time:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx .claude/skills/add-voice/scripts/live-probe.ts
```

Every line of the summary should read `yes` (the sideband line reads `n/a`:
a sideband cannot attach to a WebSocket-transport session). `session.start
rejected` with `output_creation_failed` on an account where `gpt-live-1` lists
fine means the project has no prepaid credits (see Troubleshooting). On Linux
pass `--clip <mono 16-bit 24 kHz WAV>` instead of relying on `say`.

The second probe exercises the production path itself — the adapter, its
`sdp` route, the sideband attach on a real WebRTC session — with a synthesized
caller and a canned backend reply, so no NanoClaw agent is needed:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx .claude/skills/add-voice/scripts/browser-probe.ts
```

Open the printed URL in a browser and press Start. The terminal shows the
sideband log; the line `>>> the backend reply is being spoken` is the pass.

## Done

Callers talk to the voice model; anything needing the agent is handed over and
the answer is spoken back. Session ids are logged in `logs/nanoclaw.log`; quote
one if you need OpenAI's help with a call. To add a second line for someone
else, append another token to `GPT_LIVE_LINK_TOKEN` (comma-separated), derive
its line id the same way, and repeat the named-user, membership and strict
wiring steps for `voice:<that line id>`. Restart to load the additional token.

To uninstall: see [REMOVE.md](REMOVE.md).

## The call page

The page callers open is a small React app. Its maintainer sources live at
`.claude/skills/add-voice/ui/` on the `channels` branch beside the generated payload:
Teenage Engineering inspired, one screen beside a rail of keys, a dot-matrix
display that shows the caller's voice in white, thinking in orange and the
agent's voice in orange, captions that fade in word by word, and three device
finishes. It ships as one self-contained document inside
`src/channels/gpt-live-call-page.ts` (generated, do not edit by hand), so the
host build, the copy list and the routes never change when the look does.

Change the look without a rebuild with one `.env` key holding a JSON object,
injected into the page when it is served:

```
GPT_LIVE_UI={"colorway":"field","presence":"matrix","brand":"Casa line"}
```

| key              | values                                                  | default                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `skin`           | `te` (device), `nanoclaw` (card)                        | `te`                                       |
| `colorway`       | `auto` (follows light/dark), `ivory`, `field`, `rabbit` | `auto`                                     |
| `layout`         | `rail` (screen beside keys), `stack`                    | `rail`                                     |
| `presence`       | `matrix`, `bars`                                        | `matrix`                                   |
| `brand`          | header name, up to 60 characters                        | `NanoClaw Voice`                           |
| `footer`         | footer line; `{agent}` becomes the wired agent's name   | `Voice by GPT-Live-1 · answers by {agent}` |
| `shortcuts`      | print `esc` and `space` on the keys (desktop)           | `true`                                     |
| `timestamps`     | time into the call on each transcript turn              | `true`                                     |
| `colorwayPicker` | let callers pick a finish from the page                 | `true`                                     |

Callers can also switch the finish from the three dots under the transcript;
the choice stays in their browser. To change the components themselves, edit
`ui/src` in a checkout of `channels`, then from `ui/` run
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts && pnpm build`. The build regenerates
the module and stamps it with a hash of the explicit `source-files.json` inputs;
the registry CI verifies both together. Ordinary installs copy the generated page
and do not need a frontend build. The UI has the same three-day release-age gate
as the host and requires no dependency install scripts. Try the page without a
microphone or an agent by adding `&demo=1` to any call link: it plays a scripted
call and connects to nothing.

## Channel Info

- **type**: `voice`
- **terminology**: a "line" is one call link; whoever opens it talks to the wired agent. Calls are 1:1 conversations, there are no groups.
- **platform-id-format**: `voice:{line id}` where the line id is the first 12 hex characters of SHA-256 of the link token (never the token itself). The caller's user id is the same string.
- **how-to-find-id**: derive it from the token in `.env`: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').createHash('sha256').update(process.argv[1]).digest('hex').slice(0,12))" "$GPT_LIVE_LINK_TOKEN"`; the wiring step in this skill does that for you.
- **instances**: one adapter; several lines by listing several tokens in `GPT_LIVE_LINK_TOKEN` (comma-separated), each wired on its own.
- **supports-threads**: no
- **typical-use**: a spoken conversation with one agent from a browser, for the people you hand a link to
- **default-isolation**: one named user and explicit membership per personal link; strict line policy and known-sender wiring. Different links have different voice sessions. Agent-group memory is still shared within that group; use a separate group for a demo.

## Troubleshooting

**An iPhone call pauses when the screen locks or you switch apps.** If the call
was launched as a Home Screen web app, open the same link directly in Safari
and compare: background calls have worked there while Home Screen mode paused
until returning to the app. Home Screen background calling is not yet verified.
On iOS 26, turning off **Open as Web App** when adding the link to the Home
Screen creates a browser bookmark instead. See
[WebKit’s Home Screen behavior](https://webkit.org/blog/17333/webkit-features-in-safari-26-0/#every-site-can-be-a-web-app-on-ios-and-ipados).

**A reply fails after hangup.** Voice delivery requires an active call. A reply
that cannot be spoken is reported as a delivery failure through the host retry
path. Voice does not deliver files or interactive question cards; ask questions
in plain spoken text and send attachments to another wired channel.

**The first answer on a call takes about ten seconds.** That wait is the host
creating the agent's session and starting its container, not the voice model.
Ask a second question in the same call and the reply comes back quickly, because
the container is already running. The call page says so while it waits, rather
than leaving the caller looking at a silent screen. Containers are reclaimed
when a session goes idle, so the next call pays the same first-answer cost.
**`Caller access denied` on the page.** Verify the voice user has a display name,
is a member of the answering agent, and the line has exactly one strict,
known-sender wiring. Spoken identity claims cannot grant access.

**`Unknown call link` on the page.** The `t` in the URL is not in
`GPT_LIVE_LINK_TOKEN`. Copy the link from the operator note above, or check
`.env`.

**The page says the microphone was refused.** Browsers only grant the
microphone on `localhost` or HTTPS. Use a tailnet HTTPS URL or a tunnel for
anything but a local try.

**`Could not start the call: gpt-live: session create failed: 401`.** The key
in `.env` is wrong or lacks `gpt-live-1` access. `400` usually means the
session config was rejected — the error text names the field.

**`429` with `credit_balance_exhausted` or `insufficient_quota`, or the smoke
test's `session.start` rejected with `output_creation_failed`.** The OpenAI
project has no prepaid credits. GPT-Live-1 is not free-tier eligible and every
session is refused until the balance is positive, even though the model lists
fine and other endpoints answer. Add credits at
https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/ and rerun the smoke
test. A `429` with `rate_limit` in the message is the concurrent-session cap
instead (25 sessions at tier 1).

**`sideband attach failed`.** The session was created but the host could not
open the server-side socket. Check outbound WebSocket access from the host
(a proxy that strips `Upgrade` headers) in `logs/nanoclaw.error.log`.

**The agent never gets involved.** The voice model delegates only when its
instructions say so. Ask something it cannot know (your calendar, a past
decision). If it still answers alone, check `logs/nanoclaw.log` for
`gpt-live: sideband attached` — without it no delegation reaches the host.

**Delegations arrive but nothing is spoken back.** Check the host's routing and
delivery logs for the session id. Calls require authorized wiring before they
start; a removed membership or changed wiring ends the call. An agent startup
or model-credential failure can still prevent a backend answer after a valid
call connects.

**The caller hears the answer twice.** The agent repeated the voice model's own
words. The transcript marks them as `Assistant:` lines; the formatting skill
tells the agent not to echo them — check it is present under
`container/skills/voice-formatting/`.

**`voice` is missing from `ncl` channel lists.** The factory returned null:
neither `OPENAI_API_KEY` nor `GPT_LIVE_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE` is in `.env`, or
`GPT_LIVE_LINK_TOKEN` is missing. Set them and restart.

**`401 Incorrect API key` although the key was just created.** If the item
was added with `security … -w` and typed at `security`'s own prompt, the key
was cut at 128 characters (that prompt's limit; project keys are longer).
Check with `security find-generic-password -s nanoclaw-openai -a "$USER" -w |
tr -d '\n' | wc -c` — exactly 128 means truncated. Re-add it with the
`printf … read -s KEY …` command above. A stored value that starts with
`read -s` or `printf` means the command itself was pasted at the silent
prompt — run it again and paste only the key when asked.

**`Keychain lookup failed` in the logs.** The item is missing, named
differently, or stored for another account. `security find-generic-password
-s nanoclaw-openai -a "$USER" -w >/dev/null` must succeed in a terminal as the
user the service runs as. A locked login keychain (service started before the
user logged in) fails the same way — restart the service after logging in.
