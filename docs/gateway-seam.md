# Gateway Provider Seam

A **credential gateway** is the component that holds real secrets and injects
them at the network boundary, so no credential ever enters an agent container.
NanoClaw does not implement one. It defines a seam, selects exactly one
provider per install, and owns everything about that provider's behavior that
is a NanoClaw concern: session lifecycle, human approval, reconciliation, and
the realization of whatever the provider contributes to a container spec.

This document is the contract. For which gateways exist and how one gets
installed, see [skills-model.md](skills-model.md) and the `/add-<gateway>`
skills.

## Migrating an existing installation

**Detect.** This migration applies when updating an installation that previously
used the built-in OneCLI integration, or a fork with custom gateway wiring.
Check `src/gateway-providers/installed.ts` for the selected gateway's registration
import and confirm the imported implementation exists. Startup errors such as
`No gateway provider is registered in this build` also indicate missing
materialization. A saved `NANOCLAW_GATEWAY_PROVIDER` value alone is insufficient.

**Why.** Core now ships the gateway contract rather than a built-in OneCLI
implementation. The gateway skill installs its adapter, dependencies,
registration, and agent instructions. Missing or unavailable gateways fail
closed; the host does not fall back to unrestricted network access.

**Fix.** Prefer `/update-nanoclaw`: its staged upgrade detects the existing
selection and applies that gateway's skill before cutover. OneCLI remains the
fresh simple-setup default; an existing selection is preserved.

For a manual merge, record the pre-merge revision and back up local configuration
and mutable state before changing the installation. Stop this copy's host and
agent containers before replacing live source. After merging, apply
[/add-onecli](../.claude/skills/add-onecli/SKILL.md) for an existing OneCLI install,
or the skill for the gateway already selected. Preserve its existing connection
settings and credentials. Record the matching `NANOCLAW_GATEWAY_PROVIDER` in
`.env` after installation succeeds. Do not switch gateways merely to complete
an upgrade. Forks with custom adapters must implement and register the current
contract described below.

**Verify.** Complete the selected skill's build and validation steps. Confirm its
registration import and implementation are present and match the saved selection.
Restart this copy, check host logs for successful gateway initialization, and send
a message through an existing agent. Verify a credentialed read and an action
that the gateway policy holds for human approval; confirm the approval reaches
the expected operator and its decision returns to the request. Do not treat a
successful build alone as validation of live credentials or approval delivery.

**Rollback.** For a transactional update, use the retained transaction's rollback:
`pnpm exec tsx scripts/update-nanoclaw.ts rollback --id <transaction-id>`.
For a manual merge, stop the updated host and its agent containers, restore the
pre-merge source and matching saved configuration and mutable state, reinstall
its locked dependencies, build, and restart. If installation changed an external
gateway version, restore that component separately using its recorded pre-upgrade
version and backup; Git rollback does not restore an external vault. Do not delete
shared gateway credentials as part of rollback.

## Why a seam and not a dependency

The gateway is the single most security-relevant dependency in the system and
the one most likely to differ per deployment — a hosted vault, a local proxy,
something an enterprise already runs. Baking one in made three things true that
should not be: its native protocol leaked into the spawn path, its approval
semantics were NanoClaw's approval semantics, and its container flags rode
around spec validation as raw argv.

The seam inverts all three. A provider **translates its native protocol** and
manages only resources it owns. Everything else is core's.

## The contract

`src/gateway-providers/gateway-provider-registry.ts` is the whole interface.

```ts
interface GatewayProviderDefinition {
  kind: string;
  agentSkills: readonly string[];
  sessions: {
    ensure(input: GatewaySessionInput, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<GatewaySessionLease>;
    reapOrphans?(): void | Promise<void>;
  };
  approvals: {
    legacyActions?: readonly string[];
    subscribe(decide: Decider, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<void>;
  };
}
```

**`ensure` is idempotent.** Core calls it for new and adopted sessions. The
`disposition` distinguishes creation from adoption: an adapter must not create
replacement identity for a runtime that survived a host restart. Core invokes
optional `reapOrphans` only after it has considered surviving runtimes.

The signal stops the current host's observation. Existing install-scoped
adapters can retain their signal cleanup. Adapters owning per-session resources
implement the lease's awaited `release({ kind, reason })`: `session-ended`
releases resources after runtime termination; `host-detached` stops observation
but preserves resources for a successor. A failed runtime stop also detaches,
because the runtime may still be alive. Core releases the session claim before
awaiting cleanup so a cleanup failure cannot leak the claim.

**The lease's `contribution` is typed.** `env`, `mounts`, `containers`, lineage `labels`, and a
`networkAccess` intent — never raw runtime flags. It is merged
into the `SessionSpec` _before_ validation, so admission judges the whole
session including the gateway's part of it. A provider that emits argv natively
parses it at its own boundary and fails the spawn on anything it cannot type.

**`networkAccess` is an intent, not a topology.** `{ kind: 'host' }`,
`{ kind: 'runtime', identity }`, or `{ kind: 'session-container', role }`. The
driver realizes it (`src/drivers/index.ts`) or rejects it. Egress lockdown
(`src/egress-lockdown.ts`) accepts only `runtime` targets, because only a named
runtime object can be attached to the internal network.

**Approvals are a subscription, not a workflow.** `subscribe` translates the
provider's native events into `GatewayApprovalRequest` and awaits a decision.
It never talks to a channel, never touches `pending_approvals`, and never
decides anything itself.

Core supplies an installation scope to subscriptions. Adapters reading a shared
native event stream must check `scope.ownsAgentGroup` before translation, age
checks, or any decision. Foreign requests and failed ownership lookups must leave
the native request untouched, not deny it. OneCLI implements this using the pinned
SDK callback's documented failure behavior: a thrown callback submits no decision.
Owned requests still pass every core validation and approval check.

## Default model-traffic approvals

`GatewayApprovalRequest.trigger` distinguishes a `default` network hold from an
explicit `policy` hold. Missing triggers retain human approval for older adapters.
A default hold supplies a validated `destination.host` and an active session.
Provider host contracts also declare `modelEndpoints` for API, subscription, and
OAuth-token URLs. Credential adapters resolve those URLs through
`getProviderModelEndpoint`; the network allowlist derives model hosts from
`providerModelAllowedHosts`. No adapter owns a provider-domain exception list.
Endpoint URLs must use HTTPS within that provider's declared domains. Missing
endpoint declarations fail explicitly; missing domains confer no exemption.

Core resolves the session's pinned agent provider, falling back to its group
configuration, and reads `ProviderHostContract.modelDomains`.

Requests to those HTTPS domains (including subdomains) receive automatic approval
for all paths and methods. This includes SDK discovery, telemetry, and provider
hosted app/MCP traffic. Other destinations and explicit policy holds retain human
approval. Missing declarations never imply open access. Provider packages declare
their own domains; gateway adapters must not keep model-host lists or interpret
presentation text to make approval decisions.

A provider may also declare `modelAuthorities`: exact `host:port` pairs for an
operator-configured model endpoint that is not a public HTTPS domain, such as a
model server on the host. A request to exactly that authority is approved like a
model domain; another port or a subdomain is not. Core does not decide which
schemes reach it; the selected gateway does.

Core validates identity, session ownership, freshness, expiry, and bridge health
before approving. Network restrictions and credential grants still apply. Native
gateway denials must not be converted into default holds. Native explicit approval
rules use `policy`; gateways that already permit model traffic need not fabricate
an approval event. OneCLI's native approval events are explicit policy holds;
Iron's generic network holds are default holds.

## What core owns

`src/gateway-approval-coordinator.ts` implements the one human approval flow
every gateway gets, so the flow cannot differ by provider:

- Validation and size limits on every field of a translated request.
- Validating the agent group and active session ownership. Non-durable adapters
  deny requests created before this host started; durable adapters recover only
  requests whose full binding matches the persisted record.
- Approver resolution (`pickApprover`) and delivery (`pickApprovalDelivery`).
- The `pending_approvals` row, the card, the click authorization, the terminal
  card edit, and the sweep of rows a previous host left behind — including rows
  written by an older adapter version, via `legacyActions`.
- A pending ceiling and a deadline capped independently of what the provider
  asked for.

No failure path approves. With `approvals.durable: true`, the adapter must
implement `listPending` and `decide`. Core persists the card and decision before
external delivery, retains decisions until the gateway acknowledges them, and
retries after restart. An uncertain delivery is not sent again. A changed request
binding cannot reuse an existing approval.

Durable adapters distinguish `unavailable` from a human denial. An outage must
not turn an undecided request into a permanent policy decision. The adapter may
select an exact approver and delivery instance; core still owns authorization,
expiry, persistence, and terminal card updates. Typed presentation fields use a
registered renderer and fail closed when no matching renderer is installed.

## Availability is a state, not a verdict

The bridge is supervised. If `subscribe` ends — cleanly or by rejection —
the coordinator settles holds as denied (or unavailable for durable adapters), closes session admission
(`stopGatewaySessionsForUnavailability`), stops the running sessions, and
resubscribes with capped exponential backoff. A retry that survives its
fail-fast window reopens admission (`resumeGatewaySessionAdmission`).

When approval handling and session admission run in separate processes, the
provider can implement `availability.publish` and `availability.read`. Only the
approval owner publishes health. Every host observes it without starting another
approval subscription. The provider must store health as a bounded lease: absent,
expired, or unreadable state is unavailable. Core refreshes health every five
seconds and checks it every second, with a five-second read timeout. A failed
observer check closes admission; a later healthy lease reopens it. Gateways that
do not declare this capability retain the single-process behavior.

This matters more than it looks. Closure is fail-closed by design — a session
whose credentials cannot be authorized must not run — but it must not be
terminal. A host that stays up while permanently refusing to spawn anything
drops every user message with only a log line to show for it, which is strictly
worse than crashing, because nothing restarts it.

## Selection

One provider per install, chosen by `NANOCLAW_GATEWAY_PROVIDER` and resolved
once at startup by `getGatewayProvider()` — before the DB opens, so a
misconfigured install fails immediately rather than at first spawn.

Registration is a single side-effecting import appended to
`src/gateway-providers/installed.ts`, the same shape as the driver and
provider-container-config barrels. With no provider registered, the host
refuses to start: there is no implicit default and no open-egress fallback.

Only the selected gateway's `agentSkills` reach an agent
(`selectGatewayAgentSkills`), so a container is never told about a gateway it
is not behind.

## How a gateway gets installed

Gateway skills are the one skill type that keeps its implementation on `main`,
in the skill's own `payload/` directory, rather than on a registry branch. The
reason is bootstrapping: a channel can be added later, but an install with no
gateway cannot start at all, so the payload has to be present in the checkout
that setup is running from.

A gateway skill is any `.claude/skills/<name>/` directory containing a
`gateway.json`:

```json
{ "kind": "onecli", "label": "OneCLI", "description": "…", "default": true }
```

`setup/gateways/catalog.ts` discovers them by that file and requires exactly one
`default`. OneCLI is currently the default and appears first in the advanced
setup picker; simple setup keeps it without an extra choice. Existing installs
retain their selected gateway. Changing the manifest default can change the
fresh-install preference later without changing provider login.

`setup/gateways/install.ts` applies the chosen skill through the
normal skill engine — same `nc:` directives, same journal — and stamps
`NANOCLAW_GATEWAY_PROVIDER`. The skill's `scripts/detect.ts` prints `installed`
or `absent`, which is what lets `/update-nanoclaw` recognise an install that
predates the seam and reapply its gateway before cutover
(`scripts/update/transaction.ts`).

The payload lands in ordinary paths — `src/gateway-providers/<kind>.ts`,
`container/skills/<kind>-gateway/` — and registration is one appended line in
`src/gateway-providers/installed.ts`. Nothing outside that directory is
rewritten to install a gateway.

## Gateway-owned containers

A gateway skill that runs its own long-lived containers labels them
`nanoclaw-install=<slug>` and `nanoclaw-role=gateway` (`GATEWAY_ROLE` in
`src/drivers/types.ts`), with no `nanoclaw-session`. Core never stops or reaps
those in install-wide sweeps (host residue reaping, the update cutover drain);
only the gateway's setup recreates them. After an update rollback restores
`data/`, core restarts them so their bind mounts point at the restored
directories. Uninstall still removes them with the rest of the install. Do not
add these labels to a gateway's existing Compose volumes or networks: Compose
then asks to recreate them, which loses their data.

## Mount class `gateway-trust`

Public CA material a MITM gateway needs the agent to trust. Pinned by path to
the install's `data/gateway-trust/` root, forced read-only, and — unlike
`identity-material` — permitted in the agent role, because a public
certificate is not a credential. The pinning is what makes the distinction
checkable rather than a labelling convention: a private key placed under
`materialsRoot` cannot be relabelled `gateway-trust` to get itself mounted into
an agent.

See [api-details.md](api-details.md) for the full mount taxonomy.

## Agent-provider credentials

Provider login prompts stay in the provider's existing `runAuth` hook. A
provider calls `getCredentialStore()` to resolve the selected gateway's
`scripts/credential-store.ts`; it never shells out to a named gateway, never
imports a gateway's implementation files, and never reads a gateway's
management settings. Missing adapters fail explicitly; there is no fallback to
a different gateway. This changes neither setup's screens nor its step sequence.

The store offers two ways to hand a credential to the gateway. Both come from
the one `getCredentialStore()` call; a gateway implements the second by
translating the caller's description into its own native record.

**Provider-named** — `has(provider)` and `save(provider, credential)`. The
gateway owns the whole description: it derives the host from the provider's
`modelEndpoints`, picks the record name and type, and receives the provider's
native login file, which it stores in whatever shape its own refresh
understands. Codex uses this path; its OAuth file is stored verbatim by OneCLI
and parsed by Iron.

**Caller-described** — `connection(target)`. For a provider whose credential
cannot be named by the provider alone. OpenCode is the case in point: one
install may hold keys for several backends, each on a host the operator chose,
each with its own header scheme. The target carries only the facts the provider
owns:

- `name` — one connection per name;
- `host` — the exact DNS hostname the credential is scoped to;
- `proxyValue` — the non-secret marker the runtime presents in place of the
  credential, which gateways doing selective replacement match on;
- for `kind: 'api-key'`, the `injection` header scheme;
- for `kind: 'oauth'`, the `profile` plus the provider's public OAuth `clientId`
  and `tokenEndpoint`.

The connection has three verbs. `find()` is read-only and reports whether an
entry exists and whether `keep()` can complete it; an entry stored for a
different host is offered through `confirmHostChange`, and without a
confirmation the lookup fails so a caller cannot move a credential by
forgetting to ask. `save(value)` stores or replaces the value of the entry
`find()` observed. `keep()` reconciles that entry with no new value. Native ids,
the create-versus-update choice, grant mechanics, stored formats, and refresh
scheduling never cross the seam; both writes re-read native metadata and refuse
an entry that changed since `find()`.

**The only OAuth profile is `chatgpt`.** Every installed gateway can hold
OpenAI's ChatGPT subscription login — refresh at a public token endpoint with a
public client id, a bearer access token, and an account id the gateway presents
in its own header — and nothing else. The seam names that profile rather than
describing OAuth in general; a gateway rejects any other profile. OneCLI stores
it as its native `openai` record, re-encoding OpenCode's parsed login into the
Codex file shape that record expects. Iron stores it as a token broker plus a
separate account-header secret. Parsing a provider's own login file stays in
the provider; converting to a gateway's storage format stays in the gateway.

`modelEndpoint(url)` is the one network hook. A provider calls it when the
operator enters an endpoint, so a refused URL can be corrected at the prompt;
`configure()` routes the endpoint through the gateway once prompts complete.
A gateway refuses an endpoint it can never serve by throwing, with the reason
in the message. A gateway that keeps no network allowlist declares nothing.

`PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL_CONNECTION_SEAM_VERSION` gates a provider skill whose
install needs `connection()`; an older core's store lacks it and the skill must
refuse before copying any payload.

## Account connection is separate from request approval

`ncl groups connect --host <hostname>` is a read-only, group-scoped handoff to
`GatewayProviderDefinition.connections.connect`. Core validates the group, host,
and returned URL; adapters return only `GatewayConnectionResult`. There is no
site catalog in core. The handoff cannot write credentials, grants, or network rules.

`action_required` includes a real `connect_url` and an action: `operator_console`
requires operator configuration; `oauth` represents a gateway-provided consent
flow. Neither means connected. Missing adapter support returns `unsupported`.
A credentialed API call must succeed before an agent reports success. A 401 or
403 alone cannot distinguish missing, rejected, or expired credentials from policy.

Iron supplies its official operator console for any hostname. It does not currently
provide a single-use account onboarding link; this contract does not pretend it does.
OneCLI can return its configured `ONECLI_CONSOLE_URL`; native connect_url responses
remain valid. No dashboard location is guessed from an API server address.

### Operator-approved REST reads

`NANOCLAW_GATEWAY_READ_ONLY_HOSTS` is a comma-separated list of exact API
hostnames whose GET/HEAD requests need no human card. It is empty by default.
For example, `api.github.com` enables GitHub REST reads across paths. Configure
only services whose GET/HEAD semantics the operator accepts as read-only.
This is a core approval rule, shared by all gateways, not a credential grant
or an egress allowlist. Those gateway checks still apply independently.

Adapters provide the HTTP method in `destination.method`. Core applies the
rule only to `trigger: default`, after validating the live session and request
identity. Explicit policy holds are never exempt. Missing methods, writes,
GraphQL POSTs, subdomains, nonstandard ports and malformed configuration do not
match. Changing `.env` applies to subsequent requests; restart the host when
changing a process-environment override. OneCLI's explicit native policy holds
remain authoritative.

### Uncredentialed reads

`NANOCLAW_GATEWAY_UNCREDENTIALED_READS=true` lets a `default` hold skip the card
when the gateway attaches no stored credential to it. It is off by default and
applies only when all of these hold:

- the method is GET or HEAD;
- the adapter sets `destination.sendsPayload: false`, attesting that the request
  has no body and asks for no protocol upgrade;
- the gateway's `approvals.credentialScope(destination)` answers `'none'` within
  five seconds.

A gateway derives `credentialScope` from its own credential rules. It may
over-report and must never under-report, so it answers `'none'` only from rules
at least as fresh as the ones its proxy enforces. A missing hook, an error, a
timeout or any other answer keeps the card; a request whose deadline passes
during the lookup is denied. Each card-free approval is logged with the
request's audit metadata.

This trades a human check for the egress allowlist. A request with no credential
can still carry data out in its URL and headers to any allowed host, and GET is
not proof of a read: some services act on a GET, such as publishing a
notification or submitting a form. Other methods, bodies, upgrades, explicit
policy holds and credentialed requests keep their cards. Configured read-only
hosts and model domains are decided first and are unaffected.

### Approval presentation

Gateways may supply `summary` with `agent`, `action`, `resource`, `reason`,
and bounded labeled `details`. Core validates and escapes these fields and
uses one renderer for both the human card and the saved approval. Legacy
adapters retain their `title`/`question` fallback. Malformed summaries fail
closed. These fields are display-only and cannot alter authorization.

Adapters must supply only safe display metadata: no raw request bodies,
headers, credentials or query strings. OneCLI uses its native action summary
when available; raw body previews are not forwarded. Iron’s NanoClaw front reuses the same pinned OneCLI summarizer, including its application registry
and generic fallback. HTTP POST alone is not evidence of a specific write action.
The common card states that approval applies to one request and does not
connect an account or expand credential permissions.

### OneCLI approval compatibility is an invariant

Approval action descriptions, selected details, application coverage, and generic
fallback must match the pinned OneCLI gateway. Adapters must not introduce their
own per-site descriptions or special cases. Both installed adapters normalize
OneCLI-shaped summaries through `normalizeGatewayApprovalSummary` and use the
same renderer. Identity validation, routing and decisions remain core-owned.

OneCLI supplies its native summary. The Iron adapter runs the same pinned OneCLI summary
modules and provider registry inside its NanoClaw-owned approval front, before
forwarding approved requests to unmodified upstream Iron for credential injection.
The front authenticates session identities and checks every request inside HTTPS
tunnels. Only explicit continue decisions are accepted; bridge outages, malformed
responses, timeouts and session revocation fail closed. Iron listens only on
loopback in the same container, with dial-time loopback restrictions preventing
backend access through DNS aliases. Control-plane sync cannot replace the front.
Credentialed application traffic uses HTTPS; the Iron adapter preserves the
request scheme and rejects plaintext HTTP rather than treating it as HTTPS. The
one exception is a keyless model endpoint on the host, pinned by host and port
and refused any credential. Its helper receives a 16 KiB body prefix and no authorization headers;
only the resulting summary crosses the approval channel. The original request
stream is preserved. The source is checksum-verified, its upstream tests run in
the image build, and a version mismatch against OneCLI's gateway pin fails the
build. See `gateway-compat/onecli-summary/README.md`.
